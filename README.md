# local-storage-events
This is a to-do list example that synchronizes between separate windows.

It uses local storage to store JSON data which is modified and rendered into the list.

This particular implementation only attempts to show very basic functionality.

To Use: Open two index.html windows and make changes in one, they should be reflected in the other window.
Make sure to host the site locally with something like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or on a web server. Running from a file:\\ location probably won't work.
